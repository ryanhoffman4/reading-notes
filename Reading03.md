## The ACP Process

The ACP process lets a programmer handle GitHub files with a terminal, edit them with VS code, and then use the terminal again to commit the changes and submit them to GitHub.  

### The steps and commands

- copy repository name from Github
- git clone <webpage name> (allows computer to handle duplicate of repository)
- navigate to directory of repository name in terminal
- code . (opens repository in VS Code)
- save changes in VS Code
- git add . (stages changed files)
- git commit -m "<message>" (commits changes in git with messages)
- git push origin main (finalizes updates to git files)
