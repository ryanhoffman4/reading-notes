#### The Growth Mindset
Keeping a growth mindset was the focus of this morning's course material.  My definition of a growth mindset is: *"a state of mind that maintains a perception of adversities as learning opportunities, not fuel for giving up"*.  Upon reflecting, I can use a growth mindset in my own pursuit of learning software engineering.  I have high standards for my performance, and get easily frustrated when I'm stuck on a problem for very long.  Not to mention, **I am quick to give up**.
  

#### My Self Promise:
I promise to:
1. stay enrolled in coding school until finishing
1. keep my negative attitude in check
1. ask for help after being stuck for 15 minutes
