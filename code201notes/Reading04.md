#### From the Duckett HTML book:

##### Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
- links allow user to move from one page to another
- links created with 'a' tag
- in the opening 'a' tag, write: href = 'URL' to link URL
- between tags is written the text the user clicks to acess URL
- navigating to a different website requires the full URL, aka, the absolute URL
- within the same website, the URL only needs to supply the scope of samde directory level
- this URL is called a relative URL
- directory structure of a parent directory is displayed in the terminal with 'tree'
- directories are folders which can contain other folders or files
- 'index.html' is homepage for entire website
- create an email link with 'href = mailto:"email_address@example.com"' in the opening 'a' tag
- link to specific parts of the same page using ID symbols in the href
- link to specific parts of a different page using ID symbols after the URL

##### Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-364)
- each CSS element is in its own box
- each box is either an inline box or a block level box
- block level elements always start on a new line
- inline elements flow in between surrounding elements
- an element containing other boxes is a parent element of those boxes
- inside boxes are child elements of surrounding boxes
- CSS has positioning schemes
- normal flow: every block element appears on new line
- relative positioning: forcibly move a block element to new position, relative to normal flow, other block elements are unaffected
- absolute positioning positions block element in relation to its containing element
- fixed positioning positions block elements in relation to browser window, block element still in window while scrolling
- floating elements allow other elements to float around them
- when boxes overlap, only one will display on top of the other
- z-index allows control over which element is displayed



#### From the Duckett JS book:

##### Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)
- a function groups code together to perform a task, and can be called multiple times
- a function accepts parameters, handles them with statements, then produces a return value
- use parentheses to call a function
- to declare a function, use function keyword and curly braces for instructions
- declaring a function does not call the function
- information given to function in declaration are called parameters
- information to be handled in function call are called arguments
- called functions can be assigned to variables
- the variable then stores the return value
- the variables and return values can be arrays/several values at once

##### Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”
- greater efficiency: paired programming actually takes longer, but it produces higher quality results, saving debugging trouble in the long run
- engaged collaboration: both programmers are generallty more focused than on their own
- learning from fellow students: share information and cover gaps in each other's knowledge
- social skills: meh
- job interview readiness: pair programming provides great practice for coding in front of people and explaining your thinking
- work environment readiness: be prepared for paired programming on the job
