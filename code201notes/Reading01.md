## From Duckett: HTML and CSS


### Chapter 18 - Process and Design

#### Basic Research
 - identify target audience
 - identify what visitors are looking for
 - document demographics like how often people visit

#### Site Maps
- building a site map is a critical planning step
- a site map is like a flow chart
- it functions like a story board
- it lists all pages on a site and shows how they are connected

#### Wireframes
- each page in the site map needs its own wireframe
- a wireframe is a basic blocked-out outline of text, pictures, links, etc. on a page

#### Design
- web pages should be readable to facilitate getting messages across
- elements like color, size, and kinds of objects affect their readability
- a good form of web design is to group together objects with similar function or meaning


### Chapter 1 - Structure

#### General Skimming:
HTML pages are text files that give structure to web pages with the use of tags.


### Chapter 17 - HTML5 Layout

This chapter is entirely filled with HTML5 tags and their functions.
Here is an [HTML5 tag cheat sheet](https://web.stanford.edu/group/csp/cs21/htmlcheatsheet.pdf).


### Chapter 8 - Extra Markup

This chapter goes deeper into blocks of elements.  The cheat sheet is still appropriate for this chapter.
