#### Charts!

##### Basics
- a chart is created with the canvas tag


##### Chart Shapes
- fillRect(x, y, width, height): Draws a filled rectangle.
- strokeRect(x, y, width, height): Draws a rectangular outline.
- clearRect(x, y, width, height): Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.

##### Drawing Paths
- beginPath(): Creates a new path. Once created, future drawing commands are directed into the path and used to build the path up.
- Path methods: Methods to set different paths for objects.
- closePath(): Adds a straight line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path.
- stroke(): Draws the shape by stroking its outline.
- fill(): Draws a solid shape by filling the path's content area.
