##### Domain Modeling
- modeling a domain is formulating a problem well as an object oriented model
- use a constructor function to construct an object
- contstructor function takes in arguments and assigns them to 'this' variables
- objects are instantiated with the 'new' keyword
- lots of examples of constructing objects




#### From Duckett: HTML and CSS

##### Chapter 6: "Tables"

- 'table' tags are used to create tables
- 'tr' tags indicate table row
- 'td' tags used for table data elements in each row
- 'th' tags denote table headings
- cheat sheet for table tags: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp




#### From Duckett: JavaScript and JQuery

##### Chapter 3: "Functions, Methods, and Objects"
- basic function is a block of code that carries out a task on arameters and retuns a value
- parameters and return value can be empty
- objects have properties and methods
- literal notation lists 'keys: values' seperated by commas, all enclosed in curly braces
- object.property/method accesses a property or method of said object
- update object properties with calling object property and using assingment operator
- example: hotel.room = 17
- 'this' operator lets methods of objects modify properties of same object
- languages have built in objects: javascript has 'document' object: document.title, document.url, etc.
- just about everything is an object
