#### From the Duckett HTML book:

##### HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)
- My class 4 reading notes are fairly thorough, so I'm putting the main tips for wireframes to remember while doing CSS work

- so far in working with CSS, these are the most handy properties and modifiers to utilize when building a wireframe

- fixed width model: a width property in a body tag establishes a constant width for a wrapper aroubd the page
- when the browser window size changes, boxes and text will still appear cleanly organized on page, though might be out of view

- margin: 0-auto: centers content within margins

- justify-align: space-between: this sets object in a line to fully span the marguns, by adding space between objects

- the rest of the chapter discusses examples of positioning, other layouts such as liquid or grid, and handling multiple style sheets
