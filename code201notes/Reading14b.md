[The Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

- google did research on what makes groups effective at accomplishing tasks
- their results found that all succesful groups had two things in common: members had roughly equal time to speak, and members had decent social sensitivity
- this finding also made the claim that different group structures didn't really matter
- groups can have one leader, or no leader, be top down, or be socratic, and still be effective
- also, backgrounds of group members didn't really matter 

- these two traits will be key during project week
- personally, it is good for me to work on listening more and speaking less
