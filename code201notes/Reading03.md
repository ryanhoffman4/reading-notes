#### From Duckett: HTML and CSS


##### Chapter 3: "Lists"
- three kinds of lists in html: ordered, unordered, and definition
- ordered lists have numbers, unordered lists have bullets, definition lists have a key term followed by some kind of description
- all list items are encased in li tags
- ordered list items have their li tags encased in an ol block
- unordered list items are encased in a ul block


##### Chapter 13: "Boxes"
- boxes have a heirarchy of properties
- from outside in, the list of properties is: margin, border, padding, content
- margin is the space between the box and outside elements
- border is the line that comprises the box
- padding is the space between the border and the content
- content is what is written in the box
- control different properties with box height and width, border style, color, and width, and pixel values for margin and padding


#### From Duckett: JavaScript and JQuery


##### Some Chapter 2 Review: Arrays
- arrays are sets of similar data types in contiguous memory
- declare arrays with square brackets
- let array = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
- array[0] = 'one'
- array[2] = 'three'


##### Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops
- booleans are heart of decisions and loops
- booleans have either a true or a false value
- an if statement check truth value of parenthesis, and executes code if true
- beware of type coercion: JS might change type of variable behind the scenes to make boolean evaluation compile
- short circuit values: only need to check first value of inequality depending on operator, only need one true value to evaluate 'or', and one false value to evaluate 'and'
- while loops execute code block until boolean condition is false
- for loop has while condition that constrains number of times code is executed
