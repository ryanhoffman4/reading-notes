#### Local Storage

- from the article:
- What we really want is:
  - a lot of storage space
  - on the client
  - that persists beyond a page refresh
  - and isnâ€™t transmitted to the server


- local storage allows the user to persist with same information after page refreshes
- HTML5 is the tool that accomplishes this
- localStorage is actually a JavaScript object
- localStorage.setItem() commits an item to local storage
- localStorage.getItam() references that item

- the article includes quite a bit of history on the struggles without local storage and trying to develop it, as well as some coding examples of how to use it

- set and get functions are mainly how to use local storage
