#### From the Duckett HTML book:

##### Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)
- a form is a page layout that allows the user to enter information
- examples are filling out payment information, or using the google searchbar
- types of input are text boxes, checkboxes, password boxes, dropdown menus, etc.
- virtually every form has a submit button to commit the info to the program
- a form is rendered on a webpage with the HTML form element
- every form element requires an action attribute and method attribute
- action attribute value is URL, method is either get or post
- input element creates many form controls by describing how the user inputs information
- the rest of chapter explains many kinds of inputs such as drop down menus and buttons

##### Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)
- this whole chapter is all CSS for styling lists, tables, and forms
- a CSS cheat sheet would probably be a more useful reference than reading notes



#### From the Duckett JS book:

##### Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)

- many types of events, click and submit are probably going to be the most common
- an event listener adds event to listen for onto an HTML tag
- an event handler names a function to execute once event registers

- most helpful event format: element.addEventListener('click', function());
