### The GitHub Website

  GitHub is a convenient place to store and share software and web development projects.  
The website contains repositories for storing files, and tools to convert the text on those 
files to HTML, which is a language used to code for websites.  A GitHub profile is a crucial 
component of a potential software engineer's resume, as it is convenient to advertise virtually 
every software project to any employer.



### GitHub Pages

  GitHub pages is an environment on GetHub specifically geared towards developing web pages.  
It takes GitHub repositories and makes them searchable websites.  Traditionally, repositories 
were private, and only accessed by their owners. GitHub Pages now allows owners of repositories 
to save and edit their work, and have their projects searchable in real time, making networking 
easier.  To do this, GetHub pages uses a conversion tool called Markdown.    



### Markdown

  Markdown is a formatting syntax used to convert text to HTML.  In learning to use Markdown, I can:
  * make bulleted lists
  * *write in italics*
  * **write in bold**
  * post links to help people learn more about [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
