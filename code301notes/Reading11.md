### SQL vs. No SQL


### Reading


#### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
#### SQL	vs. NoSQL
- 1) sql databases are relational databases, nosql aren't
2) sql databases are table based, nosql are document based
3) sql are vertically scalable, nosql are horizontally scalable

#### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
- tabulated data is the best fit for sql

#### Give a real world example.
- sql: MySql, Oracle
#### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
-key value pairs are the best kind of data for nosql

#### Give a real world example.
- nosql: MongoDB

#### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- nosql is better for heirarchical data, given it uses key value pairs

#### Which type of database is best for scalability?
- sql for verticle, nosql for horizontal

#### What does SQL stand for?
- structured query language

#### What is a relational database?
- a relational database is a data table establishes relationships between tabulated items, an example being a table that holds matches for user data and products they've bought or seen

#### What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- this uses a table structure, common for the sql world

#### What is a ‘schema’?
- a schema is a kind of ruleset or order as to which data a datable stores

#### What is a NoSQL database?
- it is a large collection of data that is stored with very loose relations between object properties, instead operating off key value pairs

#### How does it work?
- instead of an object being a row of data that follows strict schema, data is stored as objects that can be referenced with keys

#### What is inside of a Mongo database?
- lots and lots of data collections

#### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- mongoDB is more flexible, data is stored more leniently according to loose or no schema for a collection

#### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- duplicate data; data needs to be updated in several places to remain consistent
