### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

#### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
- greater efficiency
- engaged collaboration
- learning from fellow students
- social skills
- job interview readiness
- work environment readiness

#### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- learning from fellow students has been most helpful for me
- for my 201 project, I pair programmed with one particular student several times, and I mostly navigated
- while he drove, I learned alot more about the git system that he had already absorbed 

#### How does pair programming work?
- one programmer drives, meaning they operate the machine and take direction
- the other programmer navigates, meaning they tell the driver what to do
- this system helps one person, the navigator, think much more quickly without the need of having to type commands
- and, it helps the driver execute commands more efficiently without having to think
