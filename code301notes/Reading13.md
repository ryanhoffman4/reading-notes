### Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

#### What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
- personal computers started becoming more common in households
- as products, they were marketed to men
- computers being for men became a social narrative

#### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
- as that generation got into college, computer science professors had assumed that all of their students had grown up with a computer in the home
- this gave men an unfair advantage in studying, and was generally discouraging for women to continue the major


### Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

#### What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
- most software engineers are white
- there has been an increasing amount of diversity in tech over the last few years
- women account for almost exactly half of all software engineers, but are underrepresented in large companies


### Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

#### When are diversity efforts most successful?
- they are most successful when driven by company leaders

#### Why do diverse companies perform better?
- increasing the variety of thought within a company creates more material for a "best idea wins" philosophy

#### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
- a diverse company will be better equipped to serve more kinds of people by having things like sign language interpreters, wheel chair accessible ramps, people who are multilingual, etc.
