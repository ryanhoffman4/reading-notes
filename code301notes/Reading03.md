#### React Docs - lists and keys

##### What does .map() return?
- .map() returns a new array, one that is a modified version of the one passed

##### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
- wrap the values in curly braces!

##### Each list item needs a unique ____.
- key!

##### What is the purpose of a key?
- keys give each element in an array an identity in order to track how the array's elemnts have been modified



#### The Spread Operator

#### What is the spread operator?
- the spread operator is a list of three dots (...) that expands an iteratible object into a seperate argument per iteration

#### List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
- copying an array
- using math functions
- adding an item to a list
- combining objects

#### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
- array_1 = [a, b, c, d]
- array_2 = [e, f, g, h]
- combined_arrays = []...array_1, ...array_2]

#### Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
- oldArray = [1, 2, 3, 4]
- newItem = 5
- newArray = [...oldArray, newItem]


#### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
- object_1 = {a, b, c, d}
- object_2 = {e, f, g, h}
- combined_objects = {...object_1, ...object_2}


#### Video: How to Pass Functions Between Components
- literally can't open the video

##### In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

##### In your own words, what does the increment function do?

#### How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

#### How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?



##### Things I want to know more about:
- I would like more practice with the spread operator
- I would like to be able to open the video
