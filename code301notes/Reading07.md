### How I explained REST to my brother


#### Who is Roy Fielding?
- he is some smart guy who wrote HTTP to more effectively send packages over the internet

#### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- most of the architecture we've used so far was only designed for machines to communicate with a small number of other local machines, not any machine in the world

#### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- basic HTTP protocol is a short list of universal "verbs" or basic methods of handling information
- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH

#### What does a GET do?
- GET receives info from another system

#### What does a POST do?
- POST adds info to another system

#### What does PUT do?
- PUT replaces info in another system

#### What does PATCH do?
- PATCH partially updates info in another sytem
