#### Loops

- for loop, while loop, do while loop are the basic kinds of loops
- a while loop iterates through the same code until a condition is met
- if the condition is never met, the while loop is called an infinite loop
- a for loop executes a batch of code a fixed number of times
- a for loop has an initialization, condition, and an update
- example: for (var = i; i < 10; i++)
- var = i is initialization; i < 10 is condition; i++ is update
- i++ means i = i + 1
