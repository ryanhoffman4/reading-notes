### Code Editors

  Code should be written as clearly as possible.  Much energy and attention goes into producing code 
that effectively accomplishes an algorithm, but making it easy to read is equally important.  Code that 
is easy to read is easier for other people to understand and to fix if there is a mistake.  Code editors 
like Visual Studio Code help programmers write clear code by helping them track what they have already 
written by highlighting key words and giving them useful shortcuts with code completion aids.    



### The Command Line

  Computers didn't always have user friendly windows.  You know text based adventure games? Computer interfaces 
used to look like that all the time.  For those of you feeling ancient, the command line is a time machine back to 
the text based adventure game aesthetic.  The command line accepts user input and makes changes to the computer, kind 
of like a substitute for handling files with a mouse.
